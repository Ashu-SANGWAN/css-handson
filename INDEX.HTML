    <h2> What is CSS ?</h2>
<div class="container"><ol>
    <li > <span class="list1">Css stands for casecading style sheet</span> .</li>
<li>Css describes how html elements are not to be display on screen, paper or in other media </li>
<li> <span class="first"> Css is not necessary.</span><span class="second"> css saves a lot of work

<h2> CSS can be added to html documents in 3 ways</h2>

<div class="container2"><ul type="disk">
    <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside html elements1</li>
    <li> Internal- by using the style element in the head section</li>
    <li> External - by using link element to link to an externalcss file.</li>
    <li> The most common way to add css, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. however. <span class="second"> In this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles.</span> 
         because this is easier to demonstrate. and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="container3">
    <p>When comparing css class vs id, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand , applies a styleto one unique element. ID is also special is that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it is used by Javascript.
          </p> 
    <p>In CSS, Selectors are used to target a specify element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be appliedto to the element.
        </p>

<p> There is a wide range of selectors available, two of most commonly used are class aned ID. both are used to target elements to which a style shuld be applied.</p>
